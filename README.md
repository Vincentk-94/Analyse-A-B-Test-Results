# Analyse-A-B-Test-Results
In this project I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. Python with the Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries will be used to complete this project. 

## Statistical tests include:
* A/B testing
* Logistic regression

## Summary of key findings
- The new page is not significantly better than the old page and therefore the e-commerce website should not introduce the new page as there is not a significant advantage in doing so. 
- There is no significant effect on conversion when taking into account the country of the user.
